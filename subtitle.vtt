00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Hello, my name is Youssef Ahmed,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.500
and I'm a Computer Engineering student at Galala University,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.500
specializing in Cybersecurity.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.500
I've always been passionate about understanding

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.500
how systems can be protected —

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
and more importantly, how attackers think.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.000
That's what led me into the world of penetration testing.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.900
I enjoy exploring how networks, applications,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and servers work beneath the surface.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.100
My main focus is on finding vulnerabilities

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.000
before malicious hackers do.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.900
I use tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, and Metasploit

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.000
to simulate real-world attacks in ethical ways

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.100
and strengthen system defenses.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Another area I'm deeply interested in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.000
is firewall configuration and network security.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.500
I've learned how firewalls act as the first line of defense —

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.500
controlling traffic, detecting intrusions,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.500
and ensuring only trusted connections are allowed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It taught me how small misconfigurations

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.500
can open big security holes,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
and how precision really matters in this field.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
For me, cybersecurity isn't just about hacking or defense —

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.000
it's about understanding the logic of protection,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.500
thinking like both the attacker and the defender,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000
and staying one step ahead.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Thank you for watching, and I hope you enjoy my webpage!
