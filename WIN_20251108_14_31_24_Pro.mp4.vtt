Hello, my name is Yusuf Ahmed,
and I'm a computer engineering student

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.920
at Galala University
specializing in cybersecurity.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.800
I have always been passionate about
understanding how systems can be protected,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.360
and more importantly, how attackers think.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.200
Thats what led me into the world
of penetration testing.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.247
I enjoy exploring how networks,
applications, and servers

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.640
work beneath the surface.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.087
My main focus is on finding
vulnerabilities before

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.200
malicious hackers do.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.927
I use tools like Nmap burp-suite,
Metasploit to simulate real-world attacks

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.120
in ethical ways,
and strength system defense.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.400
Another area I'm deeply interested in is
firewall configuration

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.600
and network security.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.480
I have learned how firewalls act
as the first line of defense,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.400
controlling traffics,
detecting institutions, and ensuring

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.600
only trusted connections are allowed.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.167
It taught me how small miss configuration
can open big security holes and how

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
precision really matters in this field.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.800
For me, cybersecurity isn't
just about hacking or defensing.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.560
It's about understanding the logic
of protection,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.480
thinking like both attackers and defender,
and stay one step ahead.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.840
Thank you for watching,
and I hope you enjoyed my web page.
